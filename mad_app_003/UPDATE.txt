VERSION 0.0.3 UPDATE 20180613

This app has full functionality. Accounts can be created, users can login. Businesses can create ads, view all currently running ads, 
view history, and verify or dispute used ads. Advertisers can begin a new campaign, see their current campaigns, view their history, or
cash out. Customers can look for deals, add them to cart, redeem them, view their history, and cash out. THIS SHOULD BE EVERYTHING.

THERE ARE ALMOST CERTAINLY BUGS. One known one is printing of amounts owed. This can be quickly fixed. Please TRY EVERYTHING. If a bug is
found, report it to the proper Slack channel.
