Version 0.0.2 of the MAD app. Published 6/10/2018. Has full support for all business-action-only (does not yet have coupon use approval)
functions that will be in the production version of the app that we know about to this point. 

Only missing functionalities are the following:
Advertisers: begin a campaign, monitor open ads. 
Customers: Look for deals, add ads to cart, redeem ads. 
When an ad is redeemed, we need to first send an email to the business. They then should get on the app and go to a section titled 
redemptions. Here, they should be able to verify that a coupon was used or not. If verified, both the customer and the advertiser should
get emails saying their account has been credited. The business should be charged, then the customer and advertiser accounts credited.
